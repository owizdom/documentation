# Wallet Investigation with Herd MCP

This guide teaches you how to investigate wallets, track fund flows, and analyze on-chain behavior.

## Basic Wallet Profiling

### Scenario: Understanding an Unknown Wallet

**Step 1: Get the overview**

```
Give me a complete profile of wallet 0x...
```

**Claude returns:**
- Wallet type (EOA, multisig, smart wallet)
- Total holdings and value
- Transaction history summary
- Notable activity

**Step 2: Check history**

```
What has this wallet been doing in the last month?
```

**Step 3: Identify patterns**

```
What protocols does this wallet use most frequently?
```

### Example: Wallet Profile

```

## Whale Tracking

### Scenario: Monitoring Large Holders

**Step 1: Identify the whale**

```
Give me an overview of this known whale wallet: 0x...
What are their major holdings?
```

**Step 2: Track recent movements**

```
Show me this whale's recent token transfers
Have they been accumulating or distributing?
```

**Step 3: Analyze trading patterns**

```
What's this whale's trading strategy based on their history?
```

### Example: Whale Analysis

```
Whale Analysis: 0xWhale...
==========================

Classification: Institutional/Fund Wallet
Assets Under Management: ~$45M

Recent Activity (7 days):
- Accumulated: 500,000 UNI ($3.5M)
- Distributed: 10M USDC (to various CEXs)
- Net Position Change: +$2M in alts

Trading Pattern:
- Tends to accumulate during dips
- Holds for 30-90 days
- Takes profit in 10-20% increments

Notable Positions:
┌──────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Token        │ Holdings        │ Value          │ % Supply     │
├──────────────┼─────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ UNI          │ 2,500,000       │ $17.5M         │ 0.25%        │
│ AAVE         │ 150,000         │ $13.5M         │ $0.94%       │
│ CRV          │ 10,000,000      │ $5M            │ 0.5%         │
└──────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────┘

Insight: This whale appears to be rotating from stables into
governance tokens. Watch for potential governance proposals.
```

## Fund Tracing

### Scenario: Following Money Trail

**Step 1: Start with the source**

```
Track where funds from 0x... have gone
```

**Step 2: Follow the chain**

```
The funds went to 0xIntermediate...
Where did they go from there?
```

**Step 3: Build the complete picture**

```
Map out all the wallets connected to 0xSource...
```

### Example: Fund Flow Analysis

```
Fund Flow Analysis
==================

Source: 0xSource... (Hack proceeds)
Amount: 1,000 ETH

Flow Map:
0xSource
├── 200 ETH → 0xMixer (Tornado Cash)
│   └── Untraceable
├── 300 ETH → 0xIntermediate1
│   ├── 150 ETH → Binance Deposit
│   └── 150 ETH → 0xIntermediate2
│       └── 150 ETH → OKX Deposit
├── 250 ETH → 0xIntermediate3
│   └── Swapped to USDC → Curve
│       └── Bridged to Arbitrum
└── 250 ETH → Still sitting at 0xSource

Summary:
- 20% (200 ETH): Mixer - Untraceable
- 45% (450 ETH): CEX deposits (potentially recoverable)
- 10% (100 ETH): Bridged cross-chain
- 25% (250 ETH): Still at source address

CEX Deposits Identified:
- Binance: 150 ETH (can request freeze)
- OKX: 150 ETH (can request freeze)
```

## Protocol Treasury Analysis

### Scenario: Analyzing a DAO Treasury

**Step 1: Get treasury overview**

```
Analyze the Uniswap DAO treasury wallet
```

**Step 2: Check diversification**

```
How is the treasury diversified?
What's the breakdown by asset type?
```

**Step 3: Review spending**

```
What has the treasury spent money on recently?
```

### Example: Treasury Analysis

```
Treasury Analysis: Uniswap DAO
==============================

Address: 0xTreasury... (Safe Multisig)
Signers: 6/9 required
Timelock: 7 days

Holdings:
┌──────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Category     │ Assets          │ Value          │ Allocation   │
├──────────────┼─────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Native Token │ 50M UNI         │ $350M          │ 70%          │
│ Stables      │ 30M USDC        │ $30M           │ 6%           │
│ ETH          │ 15,000 ETH      │ $47.5M         │ 9.5%         │
│ LP Positions │ Various         │ $72.5M         │ 14.5%        │
└──────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────┘
Total: ~$500M

Recent Activity (30 days):
- Grant Payment: $2M USDC to Security Team
- Grant Payment: $500K USDC to Developer DAO
- Liquidity Provision: Added $10M to UNI/ETH pool

Burn Rate: ~$3M/month
Runway: 10+ years at current rate
```

## Suspicious Activity Detection

### Red Flags to Look For

| Pattern | What It Might Mean |
|---------|-------------------|
| Fresh wallet, large funds | Possible hack proceeds |
| Mixer interactions | Money laundering |
| Rapid CEX deposits | Cashing out |
| Contract creation spam | Scam deployment |
| Same-block transactions | Bot/MEV activity |

### Example: Suspicious Wallet

```
Suspicious Activity Report: 0xSus...
====================================

RED FLAGS:

1. Wallet Age: 2 hours old
   └─ Received 500 ETH immediately after creation

2. Source of Funds: 0xCompromised...
   └─ Known compromised wallet from Protocol X hack

3. Behavior: Splitting and mixing
   └─ Already sent to 5 intermediate wallets
   └─ One transaction to Tornado Cash

4. Current Holdings: 450 ETH ($1.4M)

RECOMMENDATION:
- Alert exchanges about intermediate addresses
- Monitor for CEX deposits
- Track cross-chain bridges

Linked Addresses:
- 0xIntermediate1 (100 ETH)
- 0xIntermediate2 (100 ETH)
- 0xIntermediate3 (100 ETH)
- 0xIntermediate4 (100 ETH)
- 0xIntermediate5 (50 ETH → Tornado)
```

## Investigation Workflow

### Complete Investigation Process

1. **Profile the wallet**
   ```
   Give me everything about wallet 0x...
   ```

2. **Check funding source**
   ```
   Where did this wallet's initial funds come from?
   ```

3. **Analyze behavior**
   ```
   What has this wallet been doing?
   ```

4. **Track outflows**
   ```
   Where have funds from this wallet gone?
   ```

5. **Identify connections**
   ```
   What other wallets has this address interacted with?
   ```

6. **Check contracts deployed**
   ```
   Has this wallet deployed any contracts?
   ```

## Tips for Investigations

<Tip>
**Start with the overview.** Get the big picture before diving into details.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Follow the money.** Track both inflows and outflows.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Check deployer wallets.** Scam token deployers often have patterns.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Look for clusters.** Multiple wallets often belong to the same entity.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use timestamps.** Activity timing can reveal automated behavior.
