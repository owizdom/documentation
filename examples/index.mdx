Explain what the Uniswap V3 SwapRouter contract does.
What are its main functions?
```

### Decode a Transaction

```
What happened in this transaction?
0x[paste any transaction hash]
```

### Check a Wallet

```
Give me an overview of vitalik.eth's wallet
```

### Find Recent Activity

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Read through the scenario** - Understand what we're trying to accomplish
2. **Follow along** - Try the same queries in your own Claude Code session
3. **Experiment** - Modify the queries for your own use case
4. **Build on them** - Combine techniques for more complex analysis

## Example Complexity Levels

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Beginner | Single tool, simple queries | "What is this contract?" |
| Intermediate | Multiple tools, follow-up questions | "Analyze this DeFi transaction" |
| Advanced | Complex analysis, combining insights | "Investigate this potential exploit" |

## Tips for Learning

<Tip>
**Start simple.** Begin with basic queries and add complexity as you get comfortable.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Ask follow-up questions.** Claude remembers context, so you can drill deeper.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Be specific.** The more specific your question, the better the answer.
