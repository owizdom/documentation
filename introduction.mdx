# Welcome to Herd MCP

Herd MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a powerful integration that connects **Claude Code** to blockchain data and smart contract analysis tools. Think of it as giving Claude superpowers to understand and analyze anything happening on Ethereum and Base.

## What is Herd?

Herd is a blockchain intelligence platform that provides:

- **Smart Contract Analysis** - Read, search, and understand any verified contract's code
- **Transaction Decoding** - Break down complex transactions into human-readable actions
- **Wallet Intelligence** - Get comprehensive wallet profiles including holdings and activity
- **Token Tracking** - Monitor token balances and transfer history

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a way to extend Claude's capabilities by connecting it to external tools and data sources. When you connect Herd MCP to Claude Code, Claude gains the ability to:

  </Card>
  <Card title="Track Tokens" icon="coins">
    Monitor token holdings and transfer history for any address

</CardGroup>

## Who is this for?

Herd MCP is perfect for:

- **Developers** building on Ethereum or Base who need to understand existing contracts
- **Security Researchers** auditing smart contracts or investigating incidents
- **DeFi Users** who want to understand protocols before interacting with them
- **Analysts** tracking wallet activity or token flows
- **Anyone** curious about what's happening on-chain

## How it works

```
You (natural language) → Claude Code → Herd MCP → Blockchain Data → Analysis
```

Instead of manually:
1. Going to Etherscan
2. Finding the contract
3. Reading through code
4. Cross-referencing transactions

You simply ask Claude:

<Note>
"What does the swap function do in Uniswap V3 Router?"
</Note>

And Claude will fetch the code, analyze it, and explain it to you in plain English.

## Supported Blockchains

Currently, Herd MCP supports:

| Chain | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Ethereum Mainnet | Fully Supported |
| Base | Fully Supported |

More chains coming soon!

## Quick Example

Here's a taste of what you can do:

**You:** "Give me an overview of vitalik.eth's wallet"

**Claude:** *Uses Herd MCP to fetch wallet data and returns:*
- Wallet type (EOA)
- ETH balance
- Top token holdings with USD values
- Transaction count
- Recent activity summary
