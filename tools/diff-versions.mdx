# Contract Version Diffs

Compares source code between contract implementation versions.

## Capabilities

- Structured diffs of code changes
- Works with proxy/implementation patterns
- Compare last two or all historical versions

## Example Queries

```
What changed in the latest USDC upgrade?
```

```
Show me the differences between the last two versions of this contract
```

```
Compare all historical versions of this upgradeable contract
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `compareAllVersions` | No | Compare all versions (default: false, only last two) |

<Note>
The contract address is automatically determined from the current context. Make sure you've referenced a contract before asking for diffs.
</Note>

## Usage

### Latest Upgrade

```
Show me what changed in the latest upgrade of the Aave V3 Pool
```

### Full History

```
Show all changes this contract has gone through since deployment
```

Uses `compareAllVersions: true` to show every upgrade.

## Understanding the Output

### Diff Format

Changes are shown in a structured format:

```diff
// File: LendingPool.sol

- function deposit(address asset, uint256 amount) external {
+ function deposit(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf) external {
      // Added ability to deposit on behalf of another address

-     _deposit(asset, amount, msg.sender);
+     _deposit(asset, amount, onBehalfOf);
  }

+ // New function added in v2
+ function flashLoan(
+     address receiver,
+     address[] calldata assets,
+     uint256[] calldata amounts,
+     bytes calldata params
+ ) external {
+     // Flash loan implementation
+ }
```

### Change Summary

```
Changes in v2.0 → v2.1:
- Modified: deposit() - added onBehalfOf parameter
- Added: flashLoan() - new flash loan functionality
- Modified: withdraw() - added safety checks
- Removed: emergencyWithdraw() - deprecated function
```

## Why This Matters

### Security Research

When a contract is upgraded, you want to know:
- Were security fixes applied?
- Were new features added that could introduce risk?
- Were any functions removed or modified?

### Protocol Analysis

Understanding how a protocol evolves:
- What features were added over time?
- How did the team respond to issues?
- What's the upgrade frequency?

### Due Diligence

Before interacting with a protocol:
- Was it recently upgraded?
- What changed in the upgrade?
- Does the new code look safe?

```
USDC Implementation Upgrade Analysis
====================================

Previous: 0xabcd... (deployed Jan 2023)
Current:  0x1234... (deployed June 2023)

Key Changes:

1. Gas Optimizations
   - Simplified internal transfer logic
   - Reduced storage reads in balanceOf

2. New Features
   - Added permit() for gasless approvals (EIP-2612)
   - Added receiveWithAuthorization() for meta-transactions

3. Security Updates
   - Added additional checks in blacklist functions
   - Updated access control modifiers

4. Removed
   - Deprecated legacy migration functions

Assessment: Standard maintenance upgrade with gas
optimizations and new signature-based approval features.
```

## Proxy Pattern Detection

The tool automatically handles different proxy patterns:

| Pattern | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Transparent Proxy | Compares implementation contracts |
| UUPS Proxy | Compares implementation contracts |
| Beacon Proxy | Compares beacon implementations |
| Diamond (EIP-2535) | Compares facet changes |

## Tips

<Tip>
Start with metadata to understand the proxy structure.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Be specific: "Did the upgrade change how withdrawals work?"
</Tip>

## Limitations

<Warning>
**Requires verified implementations.** All versions must have verified source code.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Proxy detection limitations.** Some custom proxy patterns may not be automatically detected.
</Warning>
