# Contract Metadata Tool

The `contractMetadataTool` is your starting point for understanding any smart contract. It provides comprehensive information about a contract including its code, ABI, deployment history, and token details if applicable.

## What It Does

This tool fetches:

- **Basic Info** - Contract name, compiler version, verification status
- **ABI** - Complete Application Binary Interface with function signatures
- **Proxy Information** - Implementation addresses for upgradeable contracts
- **Deployment History** - When and how the contract was deployed
- **Token Details** - If it's a token: price, volume, market cap, holders (via CoinGecko)

## How to Use It

Simply ask Claude about any contract:

```
What is the contract at 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48?
```

```
Give me an overview of the Uniswap V3 Router contract
```

```
What functions does AAVE's lending pool have?
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `contractAddress` | Yes | The contract address (0x...) |
| `blockchain` | No | `ethereum` (default) or `base` |

## Example Queries

### Basic Contract Info

**You:** "What is contract 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2?"

**Claude will return:**
- Contract name: Wrapped Ether (WETH)
- Verified: Yes
- Compiler: Solidity 0.4.18
- Functions: deposit, withdraw, approve, transfer, etc.
- Token info: Current price, market cap, holders

### Understanding a DeFi Protocol

**You:** "Explain the main functions in the Compound cToken contract"

**Claude will:**
1. Fetch the contract metadata
2. Parse the ABI to identify key functions
3. Explain what each function does in plain English

### Token Analysis

**You:** "Tell me about the USDC token contract"

**Claude will return:**
- Contract details
- Token metadata (symbol, decimals)
- Current price and market data
- Total supply and holder count

## What You Get Back

### Contract Information

```
Name: Wrapped Ether
Address: 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2
Verified: true
Compiler: v0.4.18+commit.9cf6e910
```

### ABI Summary

The tool provides function and event summaries:

**Functions:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| deposit | write | Wrap ETH into WETH |
| withdraw | write | Unwrap WETH to ETH |
| transfer | write | Transfer WETH to another address |
| approve | write | Approve spender allowance |
| balanceOf | read | Check WETH balance |

**Events:**
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Transfer | Emitted on transfers |
| Approval | Emitted on approvals |
| Deposit | Emitted when ETH is wrapped |
| Withdrawal | Emitted when WETH is unwrapped |

### Token Data (if applicable)

```
Symbol: WETH
Decimals: 18
Price: $3,245.67
Market Cap: $4.2B
24h Volume: $1.8B
Holders: 845,231
```

### Proxy Information

For upgradeable contracts:

```
Proxy Type: TransparentUpgradeableProxy
Current Implementation: 0x1234...
Previous Implementations:
  - 0xabcd... (upgraded at block 15000000)
  - 0x5678... (original)
```

## Working with Proxies

Many modern contracts use proxy patterns for upgradeability. The tool automatically:

1. Detects if a contract is a proxy
2. Identifies the current implementation
3. Provides full implementation history
4. Returns the implementation's ABI (what you actually interact with)

**You:** "Is the USDC contract upgradeable?"

**Claude will explain:**
- Yes/No
- What type of proxy pattern
- Current implementation address
- Who can upgrade it

## Combining with Other Tools

Contract metadata is often just the starting point:

1. **Get overview** → `contractMetadataTool`
2. **Search code** → `regexCodeAnalysisTool` for specific functions
3. **Check upgrades** → `diffContractVersions` for change history
4. **See usage** → `getLatestTransactionsTool` for recent activity

## Tips for Better Results

<Tip>
**Be specific about what you want to know.** Instead of "tell me about this contract", try "what are the main functions in this contract and what do they do?"
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Mention the chain if not Ethereum.** Say "on Base" for Base contracts.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Ask follow-up questions.** After getting metadata, ask about specific functions or behaviors.
</Tip>
