# Contract Metadata

Returns contract information including ABI, proxy history, and token data.

## Returns

- **Basic Info** - Contract name, compiler version, verification status
- **ABI** - Complete Application Binary Interface with function signatures
- **Proxy Information** - Implementation addresses for upgradeable contracts
- **Deployment History** - When and how the contract was deployed
- **Token Details** - If it's a token: price, volume, market cap, holders (via CoinGecko)

## Example Queries

```
What is the contract at 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48?
```

```
Give me an overview of the Uniswap V3 Router contract
```

```
What functions does AAVE's lending pool have?
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `contractAddress` | Yes | The contract address (0x...) |
| `blockchain` | No | `ethereum` (default) or `base` |

## Sample Output

For `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2`:

- Contract name: Wrapped Ether (WETH)
- Verified: Yes
- Compiler: Solidity 0.4.18
- Functions: deposit, withdraw, approve, transfer
- Token data: price, market cap, holders

## What You Get Back

### Contract Information

```
Name: Wrapped Ether
Address: 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2
Verified: true
Compiler: v0.4.18+commit.9cf6e910
```

### ABI Summary

The tool provides function and event summaries:

**Functions:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| deposit | write | Wrap ETH into WETH |
| withdraw | write | Unwrap WETH to ETH |
| transfer | write | Transfer WETH to another address |
| approve | write | Approve spender allowance |
| balanceOf | read | Check WETH balance |

**Events:**
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Transfer | Emitted on transfers |
| Approval | Emitted on approvals |
| Deposit | Emitted when ETH is wrapped |
| Withdrawal | Emitted when WETH is unwrapped |

### Token Data (if applicable)

```
Symbol: WETH
Decimals: 18
Price: $3,245.67
Market Cap: $4.2B
24h Volume: $1.8B
Holders: 845,231
```

### Proxy Information

For upgradeable contracts:

```
Proxy Type: TransparentUpgradeableProxy
Current Implementation: 0x1234...
Previous Implementations:
  - 0xabcd... (upgraded at block 15000000)
  - 0x5678... (original)
```

## Proxy Support

For upgradeable contracts, the tool:

1. Detects proxy type
2. Identifies current implementation
3. Returns implementation history
4. Provides the implementation ABI

## Tips

<Tip>
Be specific: "what are the main functions" is better than "tell me about this contract"
</Tip>

<Tip>
Specify chain for non-Ethereum: "on Base"
</Tip>
