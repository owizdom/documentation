# Latest Transactions Tool

The `getLatestTransactionsTool` fetches recent transactions that interact with a specific contract function or emit a specific event. Perfect for monitoring contract activity and finding example transactions.

## What It Does

- Finds recent transactions calling a specific function
- Finds recent transactions emitting a specific event
- Returns transaction hashes with decoded arguments
- Useful for finding patterns in contract usage

## How to Use It

Ask Claude to find recent activity:

```
Show me the last 10 swaps on Uniswap V3
```

```
Find recent mint transactions for this NFT contract
```

```
What are the latest Transfer events from USDC?
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | Yes | `function` or `event` |
| `signature` | Yes | Keccak hash of function/event (from ABI) |
| `contractAddress` | Yes | The contract to query |
| `blockchain` | No | `ethereum` (default) or `base` |

<Note>
You don't need to know the signature hash - Claude will look it up from the contract's ABI automatically.
</Note>

## Example Queries

### Finding Function Calls

**You:** "Show me the latest deposit() calls on Aave"

**Claude will:**
1. Get the contract's ABI
2. Find the `deposit` function's signature
3. Query recent transactions calling that function
4. Return decoded results

### Finding Events

**You:** "Find recent Transfer events from the PEPE token"

**Claude will:**
1. Get the Transfer event signature
2. Query recent logs
3. Return decoded transfer details

## Understanding the Output

### Function Call Results

```
Recent deposit() calls on Aave V3 Pool:

1. Transaction: 0xabc...
   Block: 18,450,123
   Timestamp: 2024-01-15 14:32:00
   Arguments:
     - asset: 0xUSDC (USDC)
     - amount: 50,000.00
     - onBehalfOf: 0xUser...
     - referralCode: 0

2. Transaction: 0xdef...
   Block: 18,450,089
   ...
```

### Event Results

```
Recent Transfer events from USDC:

1. Transaction: 0x111...
   Block: 18,450,200
   Event Args:
     - from: 0xBinance
     - to: 0xUser
     - value: 10,000.00

2. Transaction: 0x222...
   ...
```

## Common Use Cases

### Monitor Protocol Activity

**You:** "How many swaps happened on Uniswap in the last hour?"

### Find Example Transactions

**You:** "Find me an example of someone using the flashLoan function"

### Track Large Movements

**You:** "Show recent large USDC transfers (look for whale activity)"

### Analyze User Behavior

**You:** "What functions are people calling most on this contract?"

## Function vs Event

| Use Functions When | Use Events When |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| You want to see how people call the contract | You want to track outcomes/results |
| Analyzing input parameters | Tracking token movements |
| Finding failed transactions | Historical data analysis |
| Debugging contract interactions | Building activity feeds |

## Signature Hashes Explained

Each function and event has a unique identifier:

**Function signatures** (4 bytes):
```
transfer(address,uint256) → 0xa9059cbb
```

**Event signatures** (32 bytes):
```
Transfer(address,address,uint256) → 0xddf252ad...
```

Claude automatically handles these - just describe what you're looking for.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Monitoring NFT Mints

**You:** "Show me recent mints from the Azuki contract"

**Result:**
```
Recent mint() calls:

1. 0xabc... - Minted 2 tokens to 0xCollector
2. 0xdef... - Minted 1 token to 0xWhale
3. 0x123... - Minted 5 tokens to 0xTrader

Total minted in last 10 txs: 15 tokens
```

### Example 2: DEX Activity

**You:** "What pairs are being swapped most on Uniswap V3?"

**Result:**
```
Recent swap activity analysis:

Most active pairs:
1. WETH/USDC - 45 swaps
2. WETH/USDT - 23 swaps
3. WBTC/WETH - 18 swaps

Average swap size: $12,450
```

### Example 3: Governance Activity

**You:** "Show recent votes on Compound governance"

**Result:**
```
Recent VoteCast events:

1. Proposal #145: 0xVoter voted FOR (250,000 COMP)
2. Proposal #145: 0xWhale voted AGAINST (180,000 COMP)
3. Proposal #144: 0xDAO voted FOR (500,000 COMP)
```

## Combining with Other Tools

1. **Find recent transactions** → `getLatestTransactionsTool`
2. **Analyze specific tx** → `queryTransactionTool`
3. **Understand the function** → `regexCodeAnalysisTool`

## Tips

<Tip>
**Be specific about the function/event name.** "deposit" is clearer than "put money in".
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Mention the contract.** Different protocols have different function names.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Ask follow-up questions.** After seeing results, ask Claude to analyze a specific transaction.
</Tip>

## Limitations

<Warning>
**Historical depth varies.** Very old transactions may not be available.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Rate limits apply.** Don't query too frequently for the same data.
</Warning>
