# Query Transaction Tool

The `queryTransactionTool` is your most powerful tool for understanding what happened in any transaction. It decodes traces, logs, and balance changes into human-readable information.

## What It Does

- Decodes transaction calldata and function calls
- Parses event logs with decoded parameters
- Tracks all balance changes (tokens moved)
- Shows internal transaction traces
- Identifies all contracts and addresses involved

## How to Use It

Simply ask Claude to analyze a transaction:

```
What happened in transaction 0x1234...?
```

```
Decode this swap transaction: 0xabcd...
```

```
Explain all the token transfers in tx 0x5678...
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `txHash` | Yes | The transaction hash (0x...) |
| `returnAllData` | No | Return all data without filtering (default: false) |
| `balanceQuery` | No | Filter balance changes by query (e.g., "USDC transfers") |
| `traceLogQuery` | No | Filter traces/logs by query (e.g., "swap function calls") |
| `includeRawData` | No | Include raw hex calldata (default: false) |
| `blockchain` | No | `ethereum` or `base` (auto-detected if not provided) |

## Understanding Transaction Components

### Balance Changes

Shows all token/ETH movements:

```
Balance Changes:
┌──────────────┬─────────────┬────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Token        │ From        │ To             │ Amount          │
├──────────────┼─────────────┼────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ USDC         │ 0xUser...   │ 0xPool...      │ 1,000.00        │
│ WETH         │ 0xPool...   │ 0xUser...      │ 0.35            │
└──────────────┴─────────────┴────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

<Note>
Balance amounts are already decimal-adjusted (human-readable). No need to divide by decimals.
</Note>

### Traces

Internal calls within the transaction:

```
Traces:
1. 0xUser calls 0xRouter.swap(...)
   └─ 2. 0xRouter calls 0xPool.swap(...)
      └─ 3. 0xPool calls 0xUSDC.transferFrom(...)
      └─ 4. 0xPool calls 0xWETH.transfer(...)
```

### Event Logs

Decoded events emitted:

```
Events:
1. Swap (0xPool)
   - sender: 0xRouter
   - amount0In: 1000000000 (1000 USDC)
   - amount1Out: 350000000000000000 (0.35 WETH)

2. Transfer (0xUSDC)
   - from: 0xUser
   - to: 0xPool
   - value: 1000000000

3. Transfer (0xWETH)
   - from: 0xPool
   - to: 0xUser
   - value: 350000000000000000
```

## Example Queries

### Basic Transaction Decode

**You:** "What happened in 0x8a3c4b5d6e7f..."

**Claude returns:**
- Transaction summary (what the user did)
- Function called with parameters
- All token transfers
- Gas used and cost
- Success/failure status

### Filtered Analysis

**You:** "Show me only the USDC transfers in this transaction"

Claude uses `balanceQuery: "USDC transfers"` to filter results.

### DeFi Transaction Analysis

**You:** "Explain this Uniswap swap transaction step by step"

**Claude will:**
1. Identify the swap function called
2. Show input/output tokens and amounts
3. Explain the routing path
4. Calculate effective exchange rate
5. Show any fees paid

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Simple Token Transfer

```
Transaction: 0x123...
Type: ERC-20 Transfer
From: 0xAlice
To: 0xBob
Token: USDC
Amount: 500.00 USDC
Gas: 65,000 ($2.34)
Status: Success
```

### Example 2: Complex DeFi Transaction

```
Transaction: 0x456...
Type: Multi-hop Swap
Protocol: Uniswap V3

Action: Swapped 10,000 USDC → 3.5 ETH

Route:
  USDC → WETH (0.3% fee pool)

Balance Changes:
  - User: -10,000 USDC
  - User: +3.5 WETH

Events Emitted:
  1. Approval (USDC)
  2. Swap (Uniswap Pool)
  3. Transfer (USDC)
  4. Transfer (WETH)

Effective Rate: 1 ETH = 2,857.14 USDC
Gas Used: 184,532 ($8.45)
```

### Example 3: Failed Transaction

```
Transaction: 0x789...
Status: FAILED (Reverted)
Reason: "Insufficient liquidity"

What Happened:
  User tried to swap 1M USDC for ETH
  Pool didn't have enough liquidity
  Transaction reverted after consuming 45,000 gas

Gas Wasted: $1.89
```

## Filtering Options

### Balance Query Examples

```
"USDC transfers"           → Only USDC movements
"mints and burns"          → Token minting/burning
"ETH transfers"            → Native ETH movements
"NFT transfers"            → ERC-721 movements
```

### Trace/Log Query Examples

```
"swap function calls"      → Swap-related traces
"Transfer events"          → ERC-20 Transfer logs
"approval events"          → Token approvals
"admin functions"          → Privileged operations
```

## Using returnAllData

When you need everything:

**You:** "Give me the complete breakdown of this transaction with all data"

Claude uses `returnAllData: true` to return:
- All balance changes (unfiltered)
- All traces (complete call tree)
- All event logs (decoded)
- Raw data (if requested)

## Tips for Transaction Analysis

<Tip>
**Start broad, then filter.** First ask "what happened" then drill into specifics.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Ask about the "why".** "Why did this transaction fail?" or "Why were there so many internal calls?"
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Compare transactions.** "How is this swap different from transaction 0x...?"
</Tip>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if the transaction failed?">
    Claude will explain why it failed, show what it tried to do, and how much gas was wasted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see pending transactions?">
    No, only confirmed (mined) transactions can be analyzed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about internal transactions?">
    Yes! The traces show all internal calls, even those not visible on basic block explorers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
