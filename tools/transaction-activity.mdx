# Transaction Activity Tool

The `getTransactionActivityTool` provides enriched transaction history for any address, showing function calls, balance changes, and contract creations.

## What It Does

- Fetches transaction history for an address
- Shows function names and decoded parameters
- Includes balance changes per transaction
- Identifies contract creations
- Supports pagination for full history

## How to Use It

Ask Claude about an address's activity:

```
Show me the recent transactions from 0x...
```

```
What has this wallet been doing lately?
```

```
Get the transaction history for vitalik.eth
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `fromAddress` | Yes | The address to get activity for |
| `toAddress` | No | Filter to specific destination |
| `blockchain` | No | `ethereum` (default) or `base` |
| `page` | No | Page number (default: 1, 10 txs per page) |

## Example Output

```
Transaction Activity for 0xUser...
Page 1 of 15 (10 transactions per page)

1. 2024-01-15 14:32:00
   Function: swap(...)
   To: Uniswap V3 Router
   Balance Changes:
     - Sent: 1,000 USDC
     - Received: 0.35 WETH
   Gas: $4.52

2. 2024-01-15 10:15:00
   Function: approve(...)
   To: USDC Contract
   Balance Changes: None
   Gas: $2.11

3. 2024-01-14 22:45:00
   Function: deposit(...)
   To: Aave V3 Pool
   Balance Changes:
     - Sent: 5,000 USDC
     - Received: 5,000 aUSDC
   Gas: $6.78

...
```

## Filtering by Destination

To see only interactions with a specific contract:

**You:** "Show me all transactions from 0xUser to Uniswap"

This uses the `toAddress` parameter to filter results.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Wallet Investigation

**You:** "What has this wallet been doing in the last week?"

**Claude returns:**
- Recent transactions with summaries
- Protocols interacted with
- Tokens moved
- Total gas spent

### Example 2: Protocol Usage Analysis

**You:** "How does this user interact with Aave?"

**Claude filters** transactions to Aave contracts and summarizes:
- Deposits, withdrawals, borrows, repays
- Total volume
- Frequency of interactions

### Example 3: Tracking a Trader

**You:** "Show me the trading activity of this MEV bot"

**Claude returns:**
- Swap transactions
- Arbitrage patterns
- Profit/loss estimates

## Pagination

For addresses with many transactions:

**You:** "Show me page 3 of transactions for 0x..."

```
Transaction Activity for 0xUser...
Page 3 of 15

21. 2024-01-10 ...
22. 2024-01-10 ...
...
30. 2024-01-09 ...

Showing transactions 21-30 of ~150
```

## Balance Changes Explained

Each transaction shows what moved:

```
Balance Changes:
  - Sent: 1,000 USDC (to 0xPool)
  - Received: 0.35 WETH (from 0xPool)
  - Received: 50 UNI (airdrop claim)
```

<Note>
Only shows balance changes where the queried address is the holder. For complete transaction breakdown, use `queryTransactionTool`.
</Note>

## Contract Creations

When an address deploys contracts:

```
Transaction: 0xabc...
Type: Contract Creation
Created: 0xNewContract (MyToken)
Verified: Yes
```

## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Due diligence on a wallet">
    "Give me an overview of this wallet's activity over the past month"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finding specific transactions">
    "When did this wallet last interact with Compound?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Analyzing trading patterns">
    "What DEXs does this wallet use most?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tracking protocol deployments">
    "What contracts has this deployer wallet created?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Combining with Other Tools

For comprehensive analysis:

1. **Get wallet overview** → `getWalletOverviewTool`
2. **Check transaction history** → `getTransactionActivityTool`
3. **Deep dive specific tx** → `queryTransactionTool`
4. **Check token holdings** → `getTokenActivityTool`

## Tips

<Tip>
**Start with recent activity.** Page 1 shows the most recent transactions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Filter when possible.** Use `toAddress` to focus on specific protocol interactions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Ask for summaries.** "Summarize this wallet's DeFi activity" is more useful than raw transaction lists.
</Tip>

## Limitations

<Warning>
**10 transactions per page.** Use pagination for full history.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Only shows outgoing context.** Balance changes are relative to the fromAddress. Use `queryTransactionTool` for complete transaction details.
</Warning>
