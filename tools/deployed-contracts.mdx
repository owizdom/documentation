# Deployed Contracts Tool

The `getDeployedContractsTool` lists all smart contracts deployed by a specific address. Works with EOA wallets, factory contracts, Safes, and any other deployer pattern.

## What It Does

- Lists contracts deployed by an address
- Handles multiple deployment patterns (direct, factory, Safe)
- Shows deployment timestamps and transaction hashes
- Supports pagination for prolific deployers

## How to Use It

Ask Claude about deployments:

```
What contracts has 0x... deployed?
```

```
Show me all tokens created by this wallet
```

```
List contracts deployed by the Uniswap factory
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `deployerAddress` | Yes | The deployer address to query |
| `blockchain` | No | `ethereum` (default) or `base` |
| `page` | No | Page number (default: 1) |

## Deployment Patterns Supported

| Pattern | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Direct (EOA)** | Wallet directly deploys via transaction |
| **Factory** | Contract creates other contracts |
| **Safe** | Multisig deploys via execution |
| **CREATE2** | Deterministic address deployment |

## Example Output

### EOA Deployer

```
Contracts Deployed by 0xDeveloper...
====================================

Total Contracts: 15
Page 1 of 2

1. MyToken (0xToken...)
   - Deployed: 2024-01-10 14:32:00
   - Transaction: 0xabc...
   - Verified: Yes
   - Type: ERC-20 Token

2. NFTCollection (0xNFT...)
   - Deployed: 2024-01-08 10:15:00
   - Transaction: 0xdef...
   - Verified: Yes
   - Type: ERC-721 NFT

3. StakingRewards (0xStake...)
   - Deployed: 2024-01-05 16:45:00
   - Transaction: 0x123...
   - Verified: No
   - Type: Unknown

...
```

### Factory Contract

```
Contracts Deployed by Uniswap V3 Factory
========================================

Total Pools Created: 12,456
Page 1 of 1,246

1. USDC/WETH 0.3% Pool (0xPool1...)
   - Created: 2023-05-01
   - Creator Transaction: 0xabc...

2. WBTC/WETH 0.05% Pool (0xPool2...)
   - Created: 2023-04-28
   - Creator Transaction: 0xdef...

...
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Developer Portfolio

**You:** "What contracts has this developer deployed?"

**Claude returns:**
- All deployed contracts
- Contract names (if verified)
- Deployment dates
- Quick classification (token, NFT, DeFi, etc.)

### Example 2: Factory Analysis

**You:** "How many pools has Uniswap V3 factory created on Base?"

**Claude shows:**
```
Uniswap V3 Factory on Base:
- Total pools: 3,456
- Most recent: DEGEN/WETH (2 hours ago)
- Busiest day: 234 pools on 2024-01-15
```

### Example 3: Protocol Deployment History

**You:** "Show me all contracts deployed by the Aave team's deployer wallet"

**Claude lists:**
- Core protocol contracts
- Peripheral contracts
- Deployment order
- Version history

### Example 4: Finding Related Contracts

**You:** "This scam token came from 0x... - what else did they deploy?"

**Claude identifies:**
- Other tokens from same deployer
- Potential pattern of scam deployments
- Related addresses

## Combining with Other Tools

For complete deployer analysis:

1. **List deployments** → `getDeployedContractsTool`
2. **Check deployer wallet** → `getWalletOverviewTool`
3. **Analyze specific contract** → `contractMetadataTool`
4. **Search contract code** → `regexCodeAnalysisTool`

## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auditing a developer's work">
    "List all contracts deployed by this audit client's wallet"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finding protocol contracts">
    "What contracts make up the [Protocol] ecosystem?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scam investigation">
    "What other tokens has this rug-puller deployed?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Factory usage analysis">
    "How actively is this factory being used?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips

<Tip>
**Check verification status.** Verified contracts are more trustworthy and easier to analyze.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Look for patterns.** Multiple similar deployments might indicate a factory or serial behavior.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Follow the deployer.** The deployer wallet often reveals the team behind a protocol.
</Tip>

## Pagination

For deployers with many contracts:

```
Page 1: Contracts 1-10
Page 2: Contracts 11-20
...
```

**You:** "Show page 3 of contracts deployed by this factory"

## Limitations

<Warning>
**10 contracts per page.** Use pagination for complete list.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Complex factory patterns.** Some unusual factory patterns may not be fully captured.
</Warning>
