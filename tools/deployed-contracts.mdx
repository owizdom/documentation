# Deployed Contracts

Lists contracts deployed by an address. Works with EOAs, factories, and Safes.

## Returns

- Deployed contract addresses and names
- Deployment timestamps and tx hashes
- Verification status
- Paginated results (10 per page)

## Example Queries

```
What contracts has 0x... deployed?
```

```
Show me all tokens created by this wallet
```

```
List contracts deployed by the Uniswap factory
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `deployerAddress` | Yes | The deployer address to query |
| `blockchain` | No | `ethereum` (default) or `base` |
| `page` | No | Page number (default: 1) |

## Deployment Patterns Supported

| Pattern | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Direct (EOA)** | Wallet directly deploys via transaction |
| **Factory** | Contract creates other contracts |
| **Safe** | Multisig deploys via execution |
| **CREATE2** | Deterministic address deployment |

## Example Output

### EOA Deployer

```
Contracts Deployed by 0xDeveloper...
====================================

Total Contracts: 15
Page 1 of 2

1. MyToken (0xToken...)
   - Deployed: 2024-01-10 14:32:00
   - Transaction: 0xabc...
   - Verified: Yes
   - Type: ERC-20 Token

2. NFTCollection (0xNFT...)
   - Deployed: 2024-01-08 10:15:00
   - Transaction: 0xdef...
   - Verified: Yes
   - Type: ERC-721 NFT

3. StakingRewards (0xStake...)
   - Deployed: 2024-01-05 16:45:00
   - Transaction: 0x123...
   - Verified: No
   - Type: Unknown

...
```

### Factory Contract

```
Contracts Deployed by Uniswap V3 Factory
========================================

Total Pools Created: 12,456
Page 1 of 1,246

1. USDC/WETH 0.3% Pool (0xPool1...)
   - Created: 2023-05-01
   - Creator Transaction: 0xabc...

2. WBTC/WETH 0.05% Pool (0xPool2...)
   - Created: 2023-04-28
   - Creator Transaction: 0xdef...

...
```

## Use Cases

**Developer portfolio:**
```
What contracts has this developer deployed?
```

**Factory analysis:**
```
How many pools has Uniswap V3 factory created on Base?
```

**Scam investigation:**
```
This scam token came from 0x... - what else did they deploy?
```

## Combining with Other Tools

For complete deployer analysis:

1. **List deployments** → `getDeployedContractsTool`
2. **Check deployer wallet** → `getWalletOverviewTool`
3. **Analyze specific contract** → `contractMetadataTool`
4. **Search contract code** → `regexCodeAnalysisTool`

## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auditing a developer's work">
    "List all contracts deployed by this audit client's wallet"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finding protocol contracts">
    "What contracts make up the [Protocol] ecosystem?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scam investigation">
    "What other tokens has this rug-puller deployed?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Factory usage analysis">
    "How actively is this factory being used?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips

<Tip>
Check verification status—verified contracts are easier to analyze.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Look for patterns. Multiple similar deployments indicate factory or serial behavior.
</Tip>

## Pagination

For deployers with many contracts:

```
Page 1: Contracts 1-10
Page 2: Contracts 11-20
...
```

**You:** "Show page 3 of contracts deployed by this factory"

## Limitations

<Warning>
**10 contracts per page.** Use pagination for complete list.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Complex factory patterns.** Some unusual factory patterns may not be fully captured.
</Warning>
