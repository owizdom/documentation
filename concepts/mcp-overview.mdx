# Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP is the technology that allows Claude to connect to external tools and data sources like Herd. This page explains how it works and why it matters.

## The Basics

Think of MCP as a universal adapter that lets AI assistants like Claude plug into different services. Without MCP, Claude can only use its training data. With MCP, Claude can:

- Access real-time data
- Use specialized tools
- Interact with external systems

```

```

## How Claude Uses Herd Tools

When you ask Claude a blockchain question, here's what happens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Ask a Question">
    "What happened in this transaction?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude Analyzes the Request">
    Claude determines this requires transaction data and selects the `queryTransactionTool`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool Execution">
    Herd MCP fetches the transaction data, decodes it, and returns structured information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude Explains">
    Claude takes the raw data and explains it in human-readable terms.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool Selection

Claude automatically picks the right tool based on your question:

| You Ask About | Claude Uses |
|---------------|-------------|
| Contract code, ABI, what a contract does | `contractMetadataTool`, `regexCodeAnalysisTool` |
| What happened in a transaction | `queryTransactionTool` |
| Wallet balances, holdings | `getWalletOverviewTool` |
| Token transfers, history | `getTokenActivityTool` |
| Contract upgrades | `diffContractVersions` |
| Recent activity | `getLatestTransactionsTool`, `getTransactionActivityTool` |
| Contract deployments | `getDeployedContractsTool` |

## The Power of Natural Language

Instead of writing code like this:

```javascript
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, provider);
const tx = await provider.getTransaction(txHash);
const receipt = await provider.getTransactionReceipt(txHash);
const decoded = contract.interface.parseTransaction({ data: tx.data });
// ... more code to decode logs, traces, etc.
```

You just ask:

<Note>
"Decode transaction 0x123... and explain what it did"
</Note>

Claude handles all the complexity behind the scenes.

## Limitations to Understand

MCP is powerful but has some constraints:

<Warning>
**Rate Limits** - Each tool call uses your API quota. Complex analysis may require multiple calls.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Supported Chains** - Currently limited to Ethereum and Base. Other chains coming soon.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Verified Contracts Only** - Code analysis only works on verified contracts (those with source code published to Etherscan/Basescan).
</Warning>

## Security Model

Your Herd API key is stored locally in your Claude Code configuration. When you make a request:

1. The request goes directly from your machine to Herd's API
2. Herd processes the request using your API key
3. Results come back to Claude Code
4. Claude analyzes and presents the results

Your API key is never shared with Anthropic or stored anywhere other than your local machine.
