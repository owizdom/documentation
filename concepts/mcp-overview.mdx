# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP connects Claude to external data sources. Without MCP, Claude relies on training data. With it, Claude can:

- Access real-time data
- Use specialized tools
- Interact with external systems

```

## Request Flow

When you ask a blockchain question:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Ask a Question">
    "What happened in this transaction?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude Analyzes the Request">
    Claude determines this requires transaction data and selects the `queryTransactionTool`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool Execution">
    Herd MCP fetches the transaction data, decodes it, and returns structured information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claude Explains">
    Claude takes the raw data and explains it in human-readable terms.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tool Selection

Tools are selected based on query type:

| You Ask About | Claude Uses |
|---------------|-------------|
| Contract code, ABI, what a contract does | `contractMetadataTool`, `regexCodeAnalysisTool` |
| What happened in a transaction | `queryTransactionTool` |
| Wallet balances, holdings | `getWalletOverviewTool` |
| Token transfers, history | `getTokenActivityTool` |
| Contract upgrades | `diffContractVersions` |
| Recent activity | `getLatestTransactionsTool`, `getTransactionActivityTool` |
| Contract deployments | `getDeployedContractsTool` |

## Natural Language vs Code

Instead of:

```javascript
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL);
const contract = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, provider);
const tx = await provider.getTransaction(txHash);
const receipt = await provider.getTransactionReceipt(txHash);
const decoded = contract.interface.parseTransaction({ data: tx.data });
// ... more code to decode logs, traces, etc.
```

You ask:

<Note>
"Decode transaction 0x123... and explain what it did"
</Note>

## Limitations

<Warning>
**Rate Limits** - Each tool call uses your API quota. Complex analysis may require multiple calls.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Supported Chains** - Currently limited to Ethereum and Base. Other chains coming soon.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Verified Contracts Only** - Code analysis only works on verified contracts (those with source code published to Etherscan/Basescan).
</Warning>

## Security Model

Your Herd API key is stored locally in your Claude Code configuration. When you make a request:

1. The request goes directly from your machine to Herd's API
2. Herd processes the request using your API key
3. Results come back to Claude Code
4. Claude analyzes and presents the results

Your API key is never shared with Anthropic or stored anywhere other than your local machine.
