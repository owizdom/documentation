# Troubleshooting

## Connection Issues

### "MCP not found" or "Tool not available"

**Symptoms:**
- Claude says it doesn't have access to Herd tools
- MCP commands fail

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify MCP is configured:**
   ```bash
   claude mcp list
   ```
   You should see `herd` in the list.

2. **Re-add the MCP:**
   ```bash
   claude mcp remove herd
   claude mcp add --transport http herd https://api.herd.eco/v1/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

3. **Check your API key:**
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces
   - Verify the key is active in your Herd dashboard

### "Authentication failed" or "Invalid API key"

**Symptoms:**
- 401 or 403 errors
- "Unauthorized" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify your API key:**
   - Log into [herd.eco](https://herd.eco)
   - Check that your key is active
   - Try regenerating the key

2. **Check header format:**
   ```bash
   --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"
   ```
   Make sure "Bearer" is capitalized and there's a space after it.

3. **Check for special characters:**
   - If your key has special characters, ensure proper quoting
   - Try escaping quotes if needed

### "Connection timeout"

**Symptoms:**
- Requests hang and eventually fail
- Slow responses

**Solutions:**

1. **Check internet connection**
2. **Try again later** - The API might be experiencing high load
3. **Check Herd status page** for any outages

## Data Issues

### "Contract not found"

**Symptoms:**
- Error when querying a contract
- Empty results

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify the address:**
   - Check for typos
   - Ensure it's a valid 0x address (42 characters)

2. **Check the chain:**
   - Specify "on Base" if it's a Base contract
   - Default is Ethereum

3. **Contract might not exist:**
   - Verify on Etherscan/Basescan

### "No source code available"

**Symptoms:**
- Can get metadata but not code
- "Contract not verified" messages

**Explanation:**
The contract source code hasn't been published to Etherscan/Basescan.

**What you can still do:**
- View transaction history
- Check balance changes
- See event logs
- Get basic metadata

**What you can't do:**
- Search source code
- Understand function logic
- Compare versions

### "Transaction not found"

**Symptoms:**
- Error when querying a transaction
- Empty results

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify the hash:**
   - Should be 66 characters (0x + 64 hex)
   - Check for typos

2. **Wait for confirmation:**
   - Pending transactions can't be analyzed
   - Wait for the transaction to be mined

3. **Check the chain:**
   - Specify the correct blockchain

### Incomplete or missing data

**Symptoms:**
- Some fields are empty
- Partial results

**Possible causes:**

1. **Unverified contracts** - Limited data available
2. **Very old transactions** - Historical data may be limited
3. **Complex transactions** - May require multiple queries

## Tool-Specific Issues

### contractMetadataTool

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No ABI returned | Contract not verified |
| No token data | Not an ERC-20 token |
| No proxy info | Not an upgradeable contract |

### regexCodeAnalysisTool

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No matches | Try different search terms |
| Too many matches | Make query more specific |
| Truncated results | Search for specific patterns |

### queryTransactionTool

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No balance changes | Filter might be too restrictive |
| Missing traces | Use `returnAllData: true` |
| Incomplete decode | Contract not verified |

### getWalletOverviewTool

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| $0 values | Token prices not available |
| Missing tokens | May not track all tokens |
| Wrong wallet type | Detection limitations |

## Rate Limits

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**Symptoms:**
- 429 errors
- "Too many requests" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait and retry:**
   - Rate limits reset over time
   - Wait a few seconds/minutes

2. **Reduce query frequency:**
   - Batch questions where possible
   - Avoid rapid-fire queries

3. **Upgrade your plan:**
   - Higher tiers have higher limits
   - Check [herd.eco](https://herd.eco) for options

## Performance Issues

### Slow responses

**Possible causes:**

1. **Complex queries** - Multi-contract searches take longer
2. **Large results** - Full code returns are slower
3. **API load** - High traffic periods

**Solutions:**

1. Be more specific in queries
2. Use filtering options
3. Try during off-peak hours

## Getting Help

### If nothing works:

1. **Check the Herd status page** for outages
2. **Search existing issues** on GitHub
3. **Join the Discord** for community help
4. **Contact support** through [herd.eco](https://herd.eco)

### When reporting issues, include:
