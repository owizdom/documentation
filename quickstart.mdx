# Quickstart Guide

This guide will get you up and running with Herd MCP in just a few steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<Check>Claude Code installed on your machine</Check>
<Check>A Herd API key (get one at [herd.eco](https://herd.eco))</Check>

## Step 1: Add Herd MCP to Claude Code

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http herd https://api.herd.eco/v1/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Herd API key. Never share your API key publicly.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Verify the Connection

Start Claude Code and ask:

```
What tools do you have access to from Herd?
```

Claude should respond with a list of available tools including:
- `contractMetadataTool`
- `regexCodeAnalysisTool`
- `queryTransactionTool`
- And more...

## Step 3: Try Your First Query

Let's analyze a real smart contract. Ask Claude:

```
What is the USDC contract on Ethereum? Give me an overview.
```

Claude will use the `contractMetadataTool` to fetch information about the USDC contract and explain it to you.

## That's it!

You're now ready to explore the blockchain with Claude. Here are some things you can try:

### Analyze a Contract

```
Explain what the deposit function does in the Aave V3 Pool contract
```

### Decode a Transaction

```
What happened in transaction 0x1234...? (paste a real tx hash)
```

### Check a Wallet

```
What tokens does 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045 hold?
```

### Search Contract Code

```
Find all functions that use "onlyOwner" modifier in contract 0x...
```
